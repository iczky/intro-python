## Weekly Python Exercises

This week will consist of exercises about Python. We encourage you to solve the code challenges without using built-in Python methods. This approach will help you deepen your understanding of fundamental programming concepts and enhance your problem-solving skills. 

### Guidelines
- **Avoid Built-in Methods:** Try to implement solutions without relying on Python's built-in methods.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Ensure your code is robust by testing it thoroughly and considering edge cases.
- **Focus on Fundamentals:** Use this opportunity to strengthen your grasp of core programming principles.

Happy coding!
